Deadline for phase 1: Jan 29- Feb 3 (It should have been done by now)
Deadline for phase 2: Feb 26- March 03
Deadline for phase 3(final submission with documentation): 5-9 March

Here is a brief on the Goals:
For phase 1: Implement open, creat, read, write, close, lseek for files with or without using fuse. mkdir, readdir, rmdir for directory. In case you are unable to implement lseek, you can implement pread and pwrite. 

For phase 2: Implement file abstractions: block management, inode structure, data blocks, directory structure (if not done in phase 1). Port your file system into secondary memory. Implement openblock, readblock, writeblock as given in the manual. And integrate system call implementation from phase 1 with file abstraction (phase 2). 

For phase 3: Implement persistence as given in the manual. Phase 3 is the final submission wherein you are required to come with the working model along with the documentation (as specified in the manual).
For the observation book write a 2-3 page writeup about the project (step followed for phase1,2 and 3) for record keeping.
